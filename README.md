<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I built this project during my customer development process at Entrepreneur First. It saved me quite some time to scrape, structure and store businesses that I wanted to interview for our use case.

Below, a sample for looking for electricians in Berlin is shown.
